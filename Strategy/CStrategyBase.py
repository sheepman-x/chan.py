    Chan Theory Strategy Base Class
    
    This is an abstract base class for implementing trading strategies based on 
    Chan Theory (缠论). It serves as a foundation for deriving specific strategy 
    implementations.
    
    The base class intentionally contains no functionality - it is designed to 
    be inherited by concrete strategy classes that will implement the actual 
    trading logic.
    
    Derived classes should implement:
    - Entry signal generation based on Chan patterns
    - Exit signal generation 
    - Position sizing logic
    - Risk management rules
    
    This follows the principle that strategy classes should be polymorphic and 
    interchangeable while maintaining consistent interfaces with the main 
    CChan framework.
